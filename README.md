# 🌍 Multi-Environment Deployment Demo

This project showcases a complete CI/CD pipeline with **multi-environment deployment** across **Dev**, **Staging**, and **Production**, using GitHub Actions and AWS infrastructure.

---

## 🔧 Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React (Vite) → Docker → S3 / CloudFront
- **Backend:** Node.js → Docker → EC2 / ECS
- **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions
- **Infrastructure:** AWS (managed via Terraform)

## 🚀 Deployment Strategy

| Branch       | Environment | Deployment Target    |
|--------------|-------------|----------------------|
| `dev`        | Development | AWS Dev Infrastructure |
| `staging`    | Staging     | AWS Staging Infrastructure |
| `main`       | Production  | AWS Production Infrastructure |

Each push to a specific branch automatically triggers:
- App build
- Docker image push to ECR
- Environment-specific deployment via ECS / EC2 / S3
